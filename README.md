To get an interactive development environment run:


    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. 
 try the following

 ```
 (in-ns 'taquitodemo.core)
 (render "tz1gLfk5DCpouegP9tQyEw5vVogrwP6so7dm")
 ```
